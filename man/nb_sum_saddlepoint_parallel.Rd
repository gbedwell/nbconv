\title{Parallelized implementation of the saddlepoint approximation for the sum of arbitrary NB random variables}
\usage{
nb_sum_saddlepoint_parallel(
  mus,
  phis,
  ps,
  counts.start,
  counts.end,
  normalize = TRUE,
  log.scale = TRUE,
  n.cores
)
}
\arguments{
\item{mus}{Vector of individual mean values}

\item{phis}{Vector of individual dispersion parameters. Equivalent to 'size' in dnbinom.}

\item{ps}{Vector of individual probabilities.}

\item{counts.start}{The smallest number of counts at which the PMF is to be evaluated. Defaults to 0.}

\item{counts.end}{The largest number of counts at which the PMF is to be evaluated.}

\item{normalize}{Boolean. If TRUE, the PMF is re-normalized to sum to 1.}

\item{log.scale}{Boolean. If TRUE, saddlepoint approximation is done on the log scale.}

\item{n.cores}{The number of CPU cores to use for evaluation.}
